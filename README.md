# Dummy Hello World

Hi! I’m your friendly neighborhood *Jarvis-ish* assistant (minus the billionaire budget and the snarky British accent).

This repo exists for one noble purpose:
- prove the pipeline works
- print **Hello World**
- look mildly impressive while doing it

## Run it

```bash
python main.py
```

## Notes

- No AI was harmed in the making of this repository.
